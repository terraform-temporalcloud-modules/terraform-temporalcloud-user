# Local regression coverage

This directory is **not an example** — do not copy it. See [examples/](../../examples) for usage.

## Why it exists

The `examples/` directories source the *published* module from the Terraform Registry so they are
copy-pasteable for consumers. The tradeoff is that they validate the last release rather than the code
in this repository: a renamed or removed variable would pass CI unnoticed.

This directory sources the module by relative path (`../../`) and passes **every** input, so
`terraform validate` fails here the moment the variable surface changes incompatibly. It covers:

| Module call | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `all_inputs` | Every input the module accepts is still valid |
| `disabled` | `create_user = false` produces no resources and every output falls back via `try()` |
| `minimal` | The module works with only `email` and `account_access` |
| `account_admin` | An `admin` account role with no namespace grants still type-checks |
| `wrapper` | `wrappers/` accepts `defaults` / `items` and passes them through |

`outputs.tf` references every output, so a broken output expression fails here rather than in a
consumer's plan.

The apply layer covers most of this surface for real — see [../README.md](../README.md). The one input
it cannot reach is `account_access_custom_roles`, which needs a custom role ID the test key is not
allowed to create, so for that input this directory is the only automated check.

Nothing here is ever applied, and every address uses `example.com`, reserved by
[RFC 2606](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2606) so it can never receive mail. Keep it that way — an
`apply` in this directory with a real address would send real invitations.

## Maintenance

When you add a variable to the root module, **add it here in the same PR** — the `wrapper-sync` hook
guards `wrappers/main.tf`, but nothing else would catch an untested input. Adding it to `examples/` has
to wait until the next release publishes it.

CI discovers this directory automatically: the workflow globs for any directory containing a `.tf`
file with `required_version`, so no matrix entry needs maintaining.

## Running it

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
```

`terraform plan` additionally requires `TEMPORAL_CLOUD_API_KEY`, because the provider authenticates at
configure time even when no resources would be created.
